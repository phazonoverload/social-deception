## Force Push

This is actually the third version of this codebase. As time progressed and code got messier, it became easier to start from scratch. Here are the commit histories of previous versions:

###Â Version 1 & 2

Version '2' was built in a branch and introduced the move from Firebase Real Time Database to Cloudstore. The new version used Cloudstore, Nuxt.js and significantly reduced the number of DB read/writes.
